<h1>About Dog App</h1>

<p>
  The Dog App is a web application designed to provide detailed information about different dog breeds, 
  including their images, interesting facts, and common diseases. This project integrates multiple data sources 
  to deliver a comprehensive experience for users who want to learn more about various dog breeds.
</p>

<h2>Data Sources</h2>
<p>
  This application retrieves and processes data from the following sources:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Dog Breeds API:</strong>
    <a href="https://dog.ceo/api/breeds/list/all" target="_blank">https://dog.ceo/api/breeds/list/all</a>
    <p>
      This API provides a structured list of dog breeds and their sub-breeds. The data includes hierarchical 
      relationships between parent breeds and sub-breeds, which is reflected in our application's breed navigation system.
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Dog Images API:</strong>
    <a href="https://dog.ceo/api/breeds/image/random" target="_blank">https://dog.ceo/api/breeds/image/random</a>
    <p>
      The application fetches random dog images for each breed using this API. Images are stored in the database 
      and displayed dynamically on the breed detail pages.
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Dog Facts API (Locally Hosted):</strong>
    <a href="http://localhost:4567/api/facts?number=20" target="_blank">http://localhost:4567/api/facts?number=20</a>
    <p>
      This API provides interesting facts about dogs, which are randomly assigned to different breeds. 
      The API is hosted locally to ensure consistent data availability.
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Dog Diseases Dataset (CSV File):</strong>
    <p>
      A manually curated CSV file contains information on common dog diseases, including their names 
      and descriptions. This dataset is imported into the database and linked to relevant breeds 
      to provide health-related insights.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Data Structure</h2>
<p>
  The following Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) illustrates the structure of the database and how 
  different datasets are interconnected within this application:
</p>

<div class="text-center">
  <%= image_tag "ERD.png", alt: "ERD Diagram", class: "img-fluid" %>
</div>

<p>
  The database follows a relational design where:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Each <strong>Breed</strong> record represents a dog breed and may have associated sub-breeds.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Dog Images</strong> are linked to their respective breeds to visually represent each breed.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Dog Facts</strong> are assigned to different breeds to enhance user engagement.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Dog Diseases</strong> are mapped to breeds that are commonly affected by specific health conditions.
  </li>
</ul>
